**Algorithm Idea**

For substring, check if it would be equal to the whole 
array if it were to appear the necessary number of times. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 80 ms, faster than 50.23% of Python3 online submissions for Repeated Substring Pattern.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 94.54% of Python3 online submissions for Repeated Substring Pattern.
