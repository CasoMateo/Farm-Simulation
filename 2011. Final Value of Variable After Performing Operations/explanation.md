**Algorithm Idea**

Map each operation with its respective 
meaning in a hash map. Use the dictionary 
while traversing the list.


**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 48 ms, faster than 87.50% of Python3 online submissions for Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 87.50% of Python3 online submissions for Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations.
